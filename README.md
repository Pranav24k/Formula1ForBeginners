# 🏎️ F1 for Beginners

Welcome to **F1 for Beginners** — an Android app designed to help newcomers understand the basics of **Formula 1** in a simple, clean, and interactive cards

## Challenges Faced 
**Implementing LazyColumn**: One of the key challenges was efficiently displaying a list of dogs with their details. I learned to use **LazyColumn** to improve performance by recycling views as users scroll through the list And how to get data from a DataSource to a lazyColumn List.

**Theme Switching And Material Theming**: Implementing light and dark modes with **Material Design** components was a challenge, especially ensuring that all components switched correctly based on the system's theme. I gained valuable experience in applying global theming and working with theming APIs in Jetpack Compose such as defining app colors , fonts , typography etc.

**TopAppBar**: Also Learned how to add a Top App Bar using Jetpack Compose
